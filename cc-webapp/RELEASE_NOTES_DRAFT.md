 Release v1.0.0 - Initial Full Feature Set & Staging Readiness

This landmark v1.0.0 release of CC Webapp brings the application to a feature-complete state, ready for staging deployment and validation. It includes a fully interactive frontend, a robust backend with new APIs and data pipelines, comprehensive testing, and a complete Dockerized environment.

## ‚ú® New Features & Enhancements

*   **Backend APIs & Logic:**
    *   Implemented Reward History endpoint (`GET /api/users/{user_id}/rewards`) with pagination.
    *   Full Content Unlock logic (`GET /api/unlock`) including stage progression, segment validation, and `UserReward` creation.
    *   Pending Notifications endpoint (`GET /api/notification/pending/{user_id}`) to fetch and mark notifications.
    *   New Gacha Pull endpoint (`POST /api/gacha/pull`) for server-side gacha spin logic.
    *   Refined `reward_utils.py` for decoupled reward calculation and gacha item determination.
    *   Implemented Kafka integration for user actions, RFM batch job for user segmentation, corporate site visit logging, and a personalized recommendation endpoint.
    *   Added `/health` endpoint for Docker health checks and `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus monitoring.
*   **Frontend Components & UI:**
    *   Finalized `EmotionFeedback.jsx` with enhanced styling, icons, and Framer Motion animations.
    *   Full integration of `EmotionFeedback`, sound effects, and confetti into mini-games (`SlotMachine.jsx`, `RPSGame.jsx`, `Roulette.jsx`). (Note: `useEmotionFeedback` hook currently uses mocked API responses).
    *   Completed `AdultContentViewer.jsx` with API-driven content unlock, blurred thumbnails, and full media reveal in a modal.
    *   Implemented `Gacha.jsx` using the new backend `/api/gacha/pull` endpoint, with UI feedback for COIN, CONTENT_UNLOCK, and BADGE rewards.
    *   Finalized `Profile.jsx` page to display personalized recommendations fetched from the backend.
    *   Implemented `NotificationBanner.jsx` for displaying pending user notifications globally.
*   **Dockerization & Staging Setup:**
    *   Database migrations moved to a runtime `entrypoint.sh` script in the backend container, now using `pg_isready` for robust DB wait logic.
    *   Full Docker Compose setup (`docker-compose.yml`) for all services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, Zookeeper, Backend, Frontend).
    *   Added healthcheck for the backend service in Docker Compose.
    *   Provided example Prometheus configuration (`prometheus.yml`) and Grafana dashboard model (`grafana_dashboard.json`) for monitoring.
    *   Provided a sample Nginx configuration (`nginx.conf`) for reverse proxy and SSL termination in a staging/production environment.
    *   Provided a k6 load test script (`load_test.js`).

## üêõ Bug Fixes & Improvements

*   **Backend:**
    *   Improved backend startup reliability with robust DB wait logic in `entrypoint.sh`.
*   **Build & Deployment:**
    *   Resolved potential issue with build-time database migrations by moving them to runtime.
    *   Standardized Dockerfile practices for backend and frontend, including multi-stage builds for the frontend.

## üß™ Testing
*   Comprehensive backend unit tests (Pytest) for all new and modified endpoints (Unlock, Rewards, Pending Notifications, User Segment Recommendations).
*   Frontend unit tests (Jest/RTL) for key components (`EmotionFeedback.jsx`) and utility functions (`rewardUtils.js`, `useEmotionFeedback.js`).
*   End-to-End tests (Cypress) covering major user flows (slot spin, adult content unlock, profile page load, HQ site button, notification banner).
*   CI pipeline configuration (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) established for automated testing of backend and frontend (unit tests, with E2E tests noted as needing full CI setup).

## üìÑ Documentation
*   Updated `backend/README.md` and `frontend/README.md` with detailed setup, run, test, new feature information, and vulnerability scanning guidance.
*   Added a top-level `README.md` with overall project setup and Docker Compose instructions.
*   Documented new `/health` and `/metrics` endpoints in backend README.
*   Provided example monitoring configurations (Prometheus, Grafana) and Nginx setup.

## üöÄ Next Steps
*   Deploy to staging environment using the provided Docker configurations.
*   Execute full "Staging Deployment & Validation" checklist (manual Nginx/SSL setup, load testing, vulnerability scans against staging, monitoring setup).
*   Implement backend `/api/feedback` endpoint to replace mock in `useEmotionFeedback` hook.
*   Consider moving client-side game logic (Slots, RPS, Roulette results) to backend for authoritativeness.
*   Prepare for production rollout.

---
**Known Issues/Limitations:**
*   The `useEmotionFeedback` hook in the frontend currently uses mocked API responses pending the implementation of a backend `/api/feedback` endpoint.
*   Game logic for Slots, RPS, and Roulette currently determines outcomes client-side; ideally, this would be server-authoritative for a production application to prevent cheating and ensure consistency.
*   The k6 load test script and Nginx/Prometheus/Grafana configurations are examples and will need adaptation to specific deployment environments and requirements.
*   The `entrypoint.sh` for the backend uses a basic `DATABASE_URL` parser; complex URLs might require a more robust solution.
